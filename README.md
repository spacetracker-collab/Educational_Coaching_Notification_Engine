**Application**


[Educational Coaching Notification Engine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS1WBinOIcX1xqhUC8dS6rrSHlE7ib4DNtEZWBgTS4tej7fsAZmi-MsNO0mOR4WhzZbZFS7b_dVUKAV/pubhtml)

**Reason**

This is the genesis of a Notification Engine of Indias third biggest EdTech company in growth mode that has specialized in English coaching among many others. We categorize the notification into various buckets. This EdTech app is good for mentoring and mentors need to constantly push the busy workers to up their game and spend time on their platform so that they can achieve their potential.

**Was the App Built**

The EdTech organization ditched the platform strategy to go after individualized Education Opportunities like English Coaching or Civil Services. This app was supposed to be built on Ionic. I did not charge anything for this application strategy and plan.
